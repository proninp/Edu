     * Task
     * The UK driving number is made up from the personal details of the driver. The individual letters and digits can be code using the below information
     * Rules
     * 1–5: The first five characters of the surname (padded with 9s if less than 5 characters)
     * 6: The decade digit from the year of birth (e.g. for 1987 it would be 8)
     * 7–8: The month of birth (7th character incremented by 5 if driver is female i.e. 51–62 instead of 01–12)
     * 9–10: The date within the month of birth
     * 11: The year digit from the year of birth (e.g. for 1987 it would be 7)
     * 12–13: The first two initials of the first name and middle name, padded with a 9 if no middle name
     * 14: Arbitrary digit – usually 9, but decremented to differentiate drivers with the first 13 characters in common. We will always use 9
     * 15–16: Two computer check digits. We will always use "AA"
     * Your task is to code a UK driving license number using an Array of data. The Array will look like
     * data = ["John","James","Smith","01-Jan-2000","M"];
     * Where the elements are as follows
     * 0 = Forename
     * 1 = Middle Name (if any)
     * 2 = Surname
     * 3 = Date of Birth (In the format Day Month Year, this could include the full Month name or just shorthand ie September or Sep)
     * 4 = M-Male or F-Female
